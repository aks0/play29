## Court Images

Graphics on face cards are rendered using Chris Aguilar's [vectorized-playing-cards](http://code.google.com/p/vectorized-playing-cards/) SVG files. As I understand it, his work is hand-vectorized version of standard [Anglo-American court cards](http://www.madore.org/~david/misc/cards.html) which are in public domain except for back and Joker images which vary and are mostly still copyrighted and thus absent from Chris' work.
